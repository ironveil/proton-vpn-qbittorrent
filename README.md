# Proton VPN Port Forwarding Script
This is a script that allows port-forwarding to be setup on ProtonVPN for a torrenting service. The example here is for checking if the computer is connected to UK#111 & starting qbittorrent-nox with the correct port.

This script is designed to run every x minutes, to check if you are connected to a specific network or not and whether to start qbittorrent or not.
